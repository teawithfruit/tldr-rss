            <p>Apple is reportedly working on a small, wearable AI pin equipped with multiple cameras, a speaker, and microphones. It will likely run the new Siri chatbot the company plans to unveil in iOS 27. Apple wants the final version of the pin to be about the same size as an AirTag but slightly thicker. The AI pin could be released as soon as 2027, but development is still in the early stages, and the product could be canceled.</p>

            <p>Apple plans to revamp Siri later this year by turning it into an AI chatbot. The chatbot will be embedded deeply into the company&#039;s operating systems and replace the current Siri interface. The feature is a central piece of Apple&#039;s AI strategy. Apple has designed the chatbot so that its underlying models can be swapped out over time. The company will initially use Google-powered systems.</p>

            <p>Last February, a team of doctors and scientists treated a baby with severe CPS1 deficiency, a condition caused by a rare single-gene mutation that causes patients&#039; blood to be flooded with ammonia that the liver can&#039;t clear. The doctors sequenced the baby&#039;s DNA, designed a custom gene editor to fix the typo in his CPS1 gene, manufactured it on demand, and infused it into his bloodstream. The process took about six months and cost less than $1 million. Today, the baby is thriving and seemingly cured.</p>

            <p>Evaluating technical candidates is becoming harder as AI capabilities improve. Each new model forces companies to redesign tests. This post describes one company&#039;s original take-home design, how each Claude model defeated it, and the increasingly unusual approaches the company has had to take to ensure its tests stay ahead of top models&#039; capabilities. As work evolves alongside models, companies need to develop increasingly creative ways to find strong engineers.</p>

            <p>X is struggling with two incompatible goals: optimizing attention and time spent on the platform, and tight creator-follow linkage. So far, X has opted to chase KPIs like user time spent on the platform. This has resulted in creators unable to consistently reach their audience, consumers not hearing from creators they want to follow, and filter bubbles like Crypto Twitter. Either creators and users are tightly linked, or the platform algorithmically serves users an array of compelling content - you can&#039;t have both.</p>

            <p>The rush to build AI data centers prompted Elon Musk to propose putting them in space. Musk has become obsessed with the idea of SpaceX being the first to do it, but such a feat would be hard to attempt and would require the billions of dollars in capital an initial public offering could deliver. A SpaceX IPO could also help xAI catch up to rivals. SpaceX is expected to collect banks to lead the stock offering soon, with the IPO expected to be completed by July.</p>

The files reveal how Microsoft pursued, rebuffed, and backed OpenAI at various moments over the past decade.

            <p>People think software engineers are addicted to being useful, driven by an addiction to solving puzzles, or drawn by power and money. What actually motivates software engineers is often more of an internal compulsion. It&#039;s worth figuring out what really motivates you so that you can harness that compulsion most effectively.</p>

            <p>The concept of &#039;Scalable Agency&#039;, where a developer could theoretically spin up thousands of agents to complete tasks faster, relies on a flawed assumption that software engineering is an embarrassingly parallel task. Context loading is not the same as common knowledge, and reading tokens is not the same as understanding the causal chain of changes across a system. Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later. Multi-agent systems do not escape this law, they simply hit the wall of state-space explosion faster than humans do.</p>

The jobs that are dependent on the fundamentals of software aren&#039;t going to stop being dependent on the fundamentals of software.
