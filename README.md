# TLDR RSS

[![Update RSS](https://github.com/teawithfruit/tldr-rss/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/teawithfruit/tldr-rss/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

Recollection of [TLDR](https://tldr.tech) feeds. Unified into a single RSS feed.

Why?

Because `TLDR` feed publishes only one article per day, but inside this article it has many articles (around 12). I created this tool to access all of them from my RSS reader instead of having to go into each single one individually.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `MAX_DAYS` (optional): Maximum number of days in the past to fetch articles from. Defaults to 10 if not set.

Example:
```bash
MAX_DAYS=7 yarn start  # Fetch articles from the last 7 days
```
